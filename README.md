# plantUML examples

Here you will find some examples on UML diagrams that you can apply to your projects in order to explain not only how your solution is designed but also how each of the elements that integrate your solution interact among them. Most of these examples were taken from [https://plantuml.com](https://plantuml.com). However, there are some concepts about software design and object oriented programming that are not explained. So, I will provide some explanation for them.

## Requirements
If you use vscode, then you can install the [PlantUML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jebbs.plantuml) extension.

**Note:** In ubuntu host you might need to install `graphviz`. The plugin requires it in order to render the diagrams.

To install it, just open a Terminal and run:

```
$ sudo apt install graphviz
```
